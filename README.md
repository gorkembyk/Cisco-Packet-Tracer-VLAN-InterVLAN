Inter-VLAN Routing with Multilayer Switches
This project demonstrates a scalable corporate network design using Cisco Packet Tracer. It focuses on segmenting departments into different VLANs and enabling communication between them through Layer 3 switching.

🛠 Features & Technologies
VLAN Segmentation: Logically separated Marketing and Procurement departments for enhanced security and broadcast control.

Inter-VLAN Routing: Configured SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) on Multilayer Switches, eliminating the need for an external router (Router-on-a-Stick).

Trunking (802.1Q): Established trunk links between switches to carry multiple VLAN tags across the network.

L3 Switching: Optimized performance using hardware-based routing for faster packet forwarding.
